* About

Meta-repository explaining my blog architecture, decisions and linking related repositories.

This repository itself does not contain any code, but rather *serves as a wiki* to all the related repositories.

* Project management

This is the only repository that *has GitHub issues enabled*. If you want to raise an issue related to any of these projects, please do so here.

* Components

[[./doc/architecture.jpg]]

<% repos.each do |repo| %>

<%= repo.description %>

* Goals
** Learning and exploring

Let's clarify what I'm trying to achieve here, since things could certainly be done simpler.

For me however, this is more about *learning* than about practicality. I want to learn Elm, Rust, play out with WebAssembly and custom elements and I want to explore [[./doc/literate-programming.org][literate programming]] in depth.

At the same time it's a *proof of concept:* I want to see how easy and practical is it to glue components written in different languages together using WebAssembly.

** Practical application

With all that said, the project is also meant to be /actually useful/, at least for my little site.

In that regard what's most important to me is *no surprises*.

*** Runtime errors

I liked JavaScript before it was cool to like it. And for that reason I always ended up debugging incompatibilities in IE 6 and let me tell you, it wasn't much fun.

So runtime errors are something I really dislike and especially on the front-end. So when Elm came out and says "/let there be no runtime errors/", I was totally sold on it.

*** Data consistency

But I went much further. Data manipulation is done exclusively by [[https://github.com/jakub-stastny/blog.parser.post.json][blog.parser.post.json]]. There's no "/it's just a simple JSON, let's just parse it/". It's all done by this package and the rest of the ecosystem calls it for both serialisation and deserialisation.

When [[https://github.com/jakub-stastny/blog.generator][blog.generator]] runs, it will ask the running front-end what version of [[https://github.com/jakub-stastny/blog.parser.post.json][blog.parser.post.json]] does it run. It will only proceed if it's running a compatible version (Elm does semantic versioning automatically, so we can't be wrong).

And finally we use the same Org mode parser throughout the ecosystem. If a post was successfully parsed in the generation phase, it must be successfully parsed on the front-end as well.

* Decisions
** Why Org mode?

I use Org mode for everything. It might look like Org mode is just a different version of Markdown, but that's very much not the case. Org mode is just so much more powerful. By having my blog posts in Org mode, I can (and do) link sections of my blog posts from my notes and diary and I can follow such link in Emacs, without having to switch to my browser and then back.

It already supports tags out of the box and since it's an outliner, I hide all the sections that are not relevant at the moment and only concentrate on the section at hand. There's an example of that in the [[./doc/literate-programming.org][literate programming]] article.

* Pending matters
** TODO Update the per-project ZSH profile not to launch Emacs session

And alias =e= simply to =emacs=, not forgetting to load =.env/emacs.el=.

** TODO Improve =doc/architecture.jpg=

Describe the relationships better, this is just a starting point.

After that, export the Procreate file (removing time lapse) and put it into the repository.

** TODO Improve =doc/setup.org=
