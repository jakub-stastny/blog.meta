* Resources and community

This repository is only one of many packages that I wrote for my blog. For the overall architecture and documentation please see the [[https://github.com/jakub-stastny/blog.meta][blog meta repo]]. That's also the place to [[https://github.com/jakub-stastny/blog.meta/issues][raise any issues]] if you encounter any and to [[https://github.com/jakub-stastny/blog.meta/discussions][discuss the project and ask questions]].

* Understanding the code base

/Where's all the source code?/

** Literate programming

In case you're wondering where are all the <%= language %> files, you have to tangle code blocks from [[https://orgmode.org][Org mode]] files in =src= into actual <%= language %> files using Org mode in Emacs.

Don't worry about it though â€“ unless you want to set up the code locally, there is no need. Just read the Org mode files in the =src= directory, it contains well-documented code.

If you're curious why am I doing this, you can check my post on [[https://github.com/jakub-stastny/blog.meta/blob/master/doc/literate-programming.org][literate programming]].
